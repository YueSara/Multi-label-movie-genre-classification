In the far future, Duke Leto of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor 
Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. Arrakis is a harsh desert planet and the only 
source of "spice", a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness. 
It is critical for interstellar travel as it allows Spacing Guild Navigators to use a limited form of prescience to 
safely navigate interstellar space. In reality, Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen stage a coup to retake the 
planet with aid of the Emperor's Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, whose influence threatens Shaddam's 
control. Leto is apprehensive but sees the political advantages of controlling the spice planet and forming an alliance 
with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen.
